= "Trace Within a Trace"

_20 MINUTE PRACTICE_

Let's perform a "Trace Within a Trace" strategy called **Distributed Tracing** to infiltrate the 
application traces and extract valuable information to solve the issues.


== What is Jaeger?

[sidebar]

image::jaeger-logo.png[Jaeger, 400]

https://www.jaegertracing.io[Jaeger Tracing^], inspired by Dapper and OpenZipkin, is a distributed tracing system released as open source by Uber Technologies. It is used for monitoring and troubleshooting microservices-based distributed systems, including:

* Distributed context propagation
* Distributed transaction monitoring
* Root cause analysis
* Service dependency analysis
* Performance / latency optimization

https://www.kiali.io[Kiali^] includes https://www.jaegertracing.io[Jaeger Tracing^] to provide distributed tracing out of the box.

== What are you hidding, Mr/Mrs *Application*?

From the {KIALI_URL}[Kiali Console^], `*click on the 'Distributed Tracing'*` in the left navigation.

Then `*login as user{USER_ID}/{OPENSHIFT_PASSWORD} and enter the following configuration*`:

.Jaeger Settings
[%header,cols=2*]
|===
|Parameter
|Value

|Service 
|istio-ingressgateway

|===

`*Click on the 'Find Traces' button*`

Now you can see the **distributed traces** of our application.

image::jaeger-query.png[Jaeger - Query, 800]

[NOTE]
====
**Distributed Tracing** involves propagating the tracing context from service to service by sending certain 
incoming HTTP headers downstream to outbound requests. To do this, services need some hints to tie together the entire trace. 
They need to propagate the appropriate HTTP headers so that when the proxies send span information, 
the spans can be correlated correctly into a single trace.
====

`*On the right-hand side of a specific trace, take a look at the duration.*` 
The end-to-end requests takes **more than 300ms** which you could judge as **normal** but …​
Let's get more details `*by clicking a trace on title bar*`.

image::jaeger-trace-details.png[Jaeger - Traces View, 900]

Interesting ... **The major part of a call is consuming by the Catalog Service**. 
Let’s continue the investigation on the source code side.

In your {CHE_URL}[Workspace^, role='params-link'], 
`*Examine 'com.redhat.cloudnative.catalog.CatalogController' class*` in the **/projects/workshop/catalog-spring-boot/src/main** directory:

image::che-catalog-controller.png[Catalog Controller - Java code, 700]

And yes, this burns your eyes, right?! There is **a random pause in the execution of current thread** (_Thread.sleep(random.nextInt(10) * 10)_)
and basically it is complicated to understand what the developer attempted to achieve.

This piece of code is a part of the _getAll()_ method which returns the list of all products from the database.
As you are a Java expert, you are about to create a masterpiece by both simplifying the code and increasing performance.

To fix it, we will use a new tool called https://github.com/Maistra/istio-workspace[Istio Workspace^].


== What is Istio Workspace?

[sidebar]
--
https://github.com/Maistra/istio-workspace[Istio Workspace^] is a tool that let you safely develop and test on any kubernetes cluster without distracting others.

The key value proposition is to allow you run service you are working on locally but interact with the other services running in the cluster.

This way you can use your favourite tools and avoid making your machine sweating from trying to run "the whole cloud" where your application is deployed.

Additionally, you can develop and test your changes without interfering with other users. Only you would be able to see your changes before they hit the production.

* Do you have confidence that your Test and Stage environments reflect reality? 
* Are they easy to keep up-to-date with production? 
* Can you reproduce production failure in these environments or locally? 
* What about that error you keep seeing on production that’s never occurring on Test or Stage?

It has been always hard to test new functionality before it reaches production. Even more so, with the shift from a **monolith** to **microservices** and increasing scale.
It is practically impossible to spin up the entire solution on your laptop to debug and test a suspicious piece of code. Testing on production is no longer a meme. It’s reality and a necessity.

This project works with Istio and Kubernetes or Openshift to give you confidence that your changes won’t blow up production cluster and your users won’t even notice a glitch.

== Route the traffic on your local workspace

First we have to fix the problem. `*Replace the content of the 'getAll()' method*`as following:

[source,java,subs="{markup-in-source}",role=copypaste]
.CatalogController.java
----
@ResponseBody
@GetMapping(produces = MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE)
public List<Product> getAll() {
    System.out.println(">>>> getAll, but faster");
    Spliterator<Product> products = repository.findAll().spliterator();
    return StreamSupport.stream(products, false).collect(Collectors.toList());
}
----

With those changes in place we can now test it. But does it mean we have to go through the whole **build and test locally -> deploy and test on OpenShift** cycle? 
That can take a couple of minutes. Luckily, with https://github.com/Maistra/istio-workspace[Istio Workspace^], we can now start service with our changes locally, 
but in a way like it would be running as part of the application in OpenShift.

In your {CHE_URL}[Workspace^, role='params-link'],

[tabs, subs="attributes+,+macros"]
====

IDE Task::
+
-- 
`*Click on 'Terminal' -> 'Run Task...' ->  'Catalog - Route Traffic to local'*`

image::che-runtask.png[Che - RunTask, 500]
--

CLI::
+
--
`*Execute the following commands in the '>_ workshop_tools' terminal window*`

NOTE: To open a '>_ workshop_tools' terminal window, `*click on 'Terminal' -> 'Open Terminal in specific container' ->  'workshop-tools'*`

[source,shell,subs="{markup-in-source}",role=copypaste]
----
cd /projects/workshop/catalog-spring-boot
ike develop \
    --deployment catalog-v1 \
    --run 'mvn spring-boot:run' \
    --port 9000:8080 \
    --route header:ike-session-id=dist_trace
----
TIP: you kill all current **ike** process with the command: `pkill ike`

--
====

This command will deploy a new version of the service which you can access by using special routing header.

image::new-catalog-service.png[New Catalog Deployed, 700]


== Test the new version

As we have our improved service already up and running, it's time to test the new version.
You can now access application through web interface by adding `**/?route=dist_trace**` query parameter 
to the URL of deployed app:

link:{COOLSTORE_HOMEPAGE}/#!/?route=dist_trace[]

NOTE: `**route=dist_trace**` is not automatically added by Istio Workspace.
This parameter, like any other should be handled (and appropriately propagated) by the application itself.

From link:{KIALI_URL}[Kiali^], in the **'Graph' view**, `**check the new traffic**`

image::kiali-catalog-routed.png[Catalog - Route Ike, 700]

The traffic is directed to the new version of the Catalog service, but will keep all the other users still relying on the last deployed version.
Sadly, they will be still affected by the performance regression we just fixed.

We can also see directly in the console of your link:{CHE_URL}[Workspace^], that our service has been accessed, as we are printing a test message every single time `**CatalogController**` is accessed now.

image::ike-develop-catalog-hit.png[Accessing new version of Catalog Service in Che, 700]

Moreover, we can see improvements in the response time as well:

image::ike-develop-catalog-hit-jaeger.png[New traces, 800]

Just wonderful! You reduced the response time by a factor of 5! You should be proud!

Now, it is time to go deeper again!!
